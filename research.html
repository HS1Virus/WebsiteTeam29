    <h2>Research</h2>
        <h4>Existing solutions</h4>
      <p> Currently, we are producing the first ever generation of this web application. However, if we segment the parts of the web application,
          then there are many existing solutions to build parts of our application with as opposed to the entire system. Below is an outline of what we looked into,
          further analysis of this is available further down:
          
          <ul><li>Firstly, we have to build a login system
          for students, who can login via university details. The options for this include using Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Service) and setup our application through there,
          alternatively we can use UCL API which is developed by students at UCL.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
          Secondly, we got to setup a 2FA (two factor authentication system) for the online class register. There an existing articles that help to add this to our
          web app generically. We need to make sure its using Microsoft systems hence the following is suitable for example: <a href=//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/identity-server">Microsoft identity-server</a>.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            Then, we have to store the register data in some sort of database, specifically a Sharepoint list as wanted by our client. Since this part is specific, not much research
            in terms of where to store is necessary, but what is needed is how and what to access within Sharepoint and how to setup Sharepoint to actually take in and store data.
            Additionally, research is needed into APIs to use in order to communicate with Sharepoint through our web app.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            In addition, we need to allow students to fill out fortnightly forms for feedback on how lectures are currently going as well as their mental wellbeing (work pressure).
            This part requires research into existing forms available as well as systems that can securely store the forms data in order to be accessible by staff members, through
            Sharepoint. An appropriate option would be MS Forms.
          </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="project_goals">
      <h4>Device Support</h4>
      <p>This web app should support all device types, it's made for students hence compatibility between all devices is necessary.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="requirements">
      <h4>Detailed Research</h4>
      <p>This section is divided into parts describing programming language, frameworks, libraries, APIs and extras that we have researched for this project. Comparisons have also been made
          where appropriate (where we allowed flexibility of choice).
